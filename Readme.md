# BowlingKata3

## "Why?"

- to practice babel, express, jwt and web tokens
- to practice supertest, chai-http, or some other E2E test library with express

## And secondary reasons are

- to practice web3 ...or mocking a web3 service layer
- to make RESTFUL API to calculate bowling scores (but this is a secondary purpose)
